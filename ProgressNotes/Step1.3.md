# Step 1.3: Integration & Gymnasium Interface - Status Report

## Summary of changes
- Adopted Gymnasium API: `reset(seed=...) -> (obs, info)` and `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)` in `step`.
- Seeding: standardized with `gymnasium.utils.seeding.np_random`; expose `info["episode_seed"]`.
- Rendering: added `render_mode` with support for `"ascii"` only; `render()` returns a string for ascii, raises on unsupported modes.
- Info schema:
  - Unified success key: `info["is_success"]` always present (True/False).
  - Truncation: `info["TimeLimit.truncated"]` when hitting `max_steps`.
  - Solvability: `info["level_solvable"]` (bool) and `info["ensure_solvable_enabled"]` flag; `optimal_length` and `solver_limits` when enforced.
  - Image mode provides `info["channel_names"]` for logging channel mapping.
- Observation spaces:
  - Image: float32 in [0,1], shapes respect `channels_first`.
  - Symbolic: finite bounds reflecting grid indices; documented as absolute indices (not normalized).
- Performance: cached static wall channels per reset to avoid recomputation.
- Compatibility helpers: `close()` no-op and legacy `seed()` (prefer `reset(seed=...)`).
- Registration: `register_env(env_id, max_episode_steps=...)` helper with duplicate-guard; docs warn about duplicate time limits.

## Rationale and design choices
- Success declared via a single `is_success` key to match common RL tooling (e.g., SB3 callbacks).
- Tri-state solvability replaced by boolean plus explicit enable flag for simpler downstream logic.
- Keeping only ascii render avoids premature complexity; API leaves room for future `rgb_array`.
- Symbolic bounds tightened to help normalization and policy initialization in downstream libraries.

## Current status
- Tests pass with the updated API and info schema.
- Docs updated (README, ProgressNotes) to reflect seeding, rendering, and registration usage.

## Known caveats / notes
- Internal `max_steps` enforces a time limit; wrapping additionally with Gymâ€™s `TimeLimit` via registry or outside wrappers can duplicate truncation signaling.
- Registration entry point assumes the project root is importable (`PYTHONPATH` or `pip install -e .`).
- If future code introduces mutable walls mid-episode, revisit wall-channel caching.

## Suggested follow-ups
- Packaging: add `pyproject.toml` to enable `pip install -e .` and stable entry points.
- Optional: normalization option for symbolic observations.
- Optional: typed direction constants in `ricochet_env` for documentation symmetry.
