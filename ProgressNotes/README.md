## Progress Notes Overview

This folder tracks environment and solver progress, decisions, and next steps.

Key files updated for Stage 1.4:

- `env_status.md`: Current environment capabilities, spec-driven generator, determinism, and rendering.
- `solver_status.md`: Solver status and suggested validation tasks.
- `decisions_and_rationale.md`: Why specific implementation choices were made.
- `next_steps.md`: Concrete follow-ups and tests to add.

See `env/WallSpecifications.md` for the authoritative constraints that the generator enforces.
# Progress Notes

This folder captures the current state of Step 1 (environment + solver) and related integration, plus guidance for Step 2.

## Contents
