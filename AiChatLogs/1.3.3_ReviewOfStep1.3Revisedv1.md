I'll scan the environment and tests to review how Step 1.3 (Gym/Gymnasium integration) was implemented, focusing on API correctness, spaces, seeding, determinism, and compatibility.

I’ve reviewed the Step 1.3 Gym/Gymnasium integration in `env/ricochet_env.py`, plus related tests. I’ll focus on API correctness, determinism/seeding, spaces, rendering, and downstream library compatibility.

- Bold = priority.

- **Gymnasium render API compliance**: The class advertises `metadata = {"render_modes": ["ascii"], "render_fps": 4}` but does not accept a `render_mode` argument in `__init__`, nor store `self.render_mode`, and `render()` doesn’t branch on mode or return `None` when not matching the configured mode. The typical Gymnasium pattern is `__init__(..., render_mode: Optional[str] = None)` and `render()` behavior dependent on that. As-is, integration with wrappers or tools expecting the standard pattern may be brittle.

- **Seeding protocol not following Gymnasium conventions**: `reset(seed=...)` swaps in a new `np.random.default_rng(seed)`, but it doesn’t call `super().reset(seed)` nor expose `self.np_random`. Many libraries (including SB3) expect Gym/Gymnasium’s `np_random` seeding convention to ensure uniform determinism and wrapper compatibility. Consider adopting `self.np_random, seed = gymnasium.utils.seeding.np_random(seed)` and returning the final seed in `info` for reproducibility.

- **Missing `close()` and optional `seed()` methods**: While not strictly required, many environments provide `close()` (even as a no-op) and, for legacy compatibility, a `seed()` method. Some tooling calls these defensively.

- **Registration not provided**: Step 1.3 mentions registration; there’s no module-level registration via `gymnasium.envs.registration.register` or an entry point for `gym.make("RicochetRobots-v0")`. Adding a small registration helper or documenting how to instantiate the env directly would improve plug-and-play use with RL libs.

- **Truncation/termination signaling**: The logic sets `terminated` on goal and `truncated` on step limit; that matches Gymnasium 0.26+ five-return API. However, you don’t surface a standardized time-limit key (e.g., `"TimeLimit.truncated"`) in `info`. If users wrap with `TimeLimit`, that wrapper usually injects the key, but here the env is handling truncation itself. Consider aligning with wrapper expectations or documenting that truncation is handled internally.

- **Info consistency and evaluation hooks**: You set `info["success"] = True` on goal. That’s helpful. Consider also exposing a stable success metric in every step’s `info` (e.g., `info["is_success"] = bool`) for callbacks that compute success rate without needing to guard for absent keys. Similarly, including the `seed` used for this episode in `info` would help exact reproduction.

- **Observation-space bounds and semantics**:
  - Image mode uses `[0,1]` with float32 and correct shapes; good.
  - Symbolic mode sets `low=-inf, high=inf`. That’s valid but suboptimal for agents that rely on space bounds for normalization/initialization. Tighter, known bounds (e.g., `[0, H-1]`/`[0, W-1]` for positions, one-hot in `[0,1]`) improve downstream behavior.

- **Performance: recomputing static wall channels each step**: `_board_to_image_obs` iterates every cell and recomputes the four wall channels each step, even though walls don’t change. You could precompute and cache the wall tensors at reset for a given layout (and reuse with `channels_first` transpose), then only rewrite dynamic channels (goal, target marker, robots) on each step. This will matter for larger boards and vectorized rollout.

- **Action validation**: `_decode_action` guards invalid indices and noop misuse; good. In `step()`, you don’t validate action range before the noop branch. It’s fine since action space restricts sampling, but a quick range check up-front would fail fast on user-provided bad actions and give cleaner error messages.

- **Determinism details**: With `fixed_layout`, resets are deterministic. With random generation, using `self._rng` is good. Because solver use is conditional in `ensure_solvable`, reproducibility depends on solver determinism (which seems deterministic given consistent expansion order). Consider documenting that determinism holds given a fixed seed and the current solver settings.

- **Render return type and ergonomics**: `render()` returns a string. Gymnasium typically returns a frame or `None` depending on mode. Returning a string is fine for `'ascii'`, but many tools expect `np.ndarray` for “rgb_array”. If you plan future modes, keep the interface consistent, and consider a `render_mode="ascii"` in `__init__` so the method can validate mode and return the right type.

- **Spaces when Gymnasium missing**: The minimal `_SpacesDummy` helps type usage and local tests pass even without Gymnasium installed. That’s practical, but be aware that users relying on Gymnasium wrappers won’t benefit from them in that configuration. It’s OK as a fallback; document it in the README.

- **Channel semantics clarity**: In image observations, channel 5 marks the current position of the target robot, and robot channels start at 6 by robot id. That’s sensible. Consider documenting this mapping via a public attribute or docstring so consumers can parse observations without reading code.

- **Solver metadata in reset info**: When `ensure_solvable=True`, you include `optimal_length` and `solver_limits`. Good. If you plan to filter levels by difficulty later (curriculum), consider also including the solution action list length only (not the path) and a flag that solvability was verified vs. heuristic cutoff.

- **Type hints and docstrings for public methods**: The env is easy to read, but short docstrings on `reset`, `step`, and `render` describing returns and info keys would help external users.

- **Minor: naming and alignment with Gymnasium docs**: Class name and API are fine. If you later add wrappers or vectorization, consider ensuring `observation_space.dtype` aligns with actual returned dtype across both modes (it does today).

Overall, the implementation is close to spec-compliant and works well with the tests. The highest-impact fixes for broader compatibility are addressing the render API shape (`render_mode`) and adopting the standard seeding protocol (`np_random` via `super().reset(seed)`), plus optional registration for `gym.make`.

- I’ve finished the review and will stop here.

I'll re-scan the environment implementation and tests to verify the recent changes for Step 1.3, focusing on seeding, render_mode handling, API returns, spaces, and registration.

Here’s a second-round review of Step 1.3 after your colleague’s updates. I’ve focused on Gymnasium API correctness, determinism/seeding, render API, spaces, registration, and downstream compatibility. Items are ordered by importance.

- Bold = priority.

- **Registration helper uses non-portable registry check**: In `register_env`, you test `if env_id in gym.registry`. In Gymnasium, `gym.registry` usually doesn’t exist; the canonical registry lives under `gymnasium.envs.registration` (and the recommended duplicate guard is to catch AlreadyRegistered on `register`). This check can raise or silently never guard duplicates depending on version. Suggest:
  - Drop the direct registry check; call `register(...)` inside try/except and swallow the “already registered” error.
  - Ensure `entry_point="env.ricochet_env:RicochetRobotsEnv"` is importable from the user’s PYTHONPATH (document that users must `pip install -e .` or adjust PYTHONPATH).

- **Render API consistency and discoverability**: You added `render_mode` and only support `"ascii"`. That’s good. Two small improvements:
  - Add a friendly error in `render()` if `render_mode` is unsupported but set (right now it returns `None`; that’s okay, but a clear error for non-ascii modes would aid debugging).
  - Consider documenting in the class docstring that `"ascii"` returns `str`, and no `"rgb_array"` is provided yet.

- **Seeding protocol adoption looks correct, but minor polish is possible**:
  - You use `gymnasium.utils.seeding.np_random` and store `self.np_random` plus `episode_seed` in `info`; great.
  - Since you don’t call `super().reset(seed=...)`, you’re relying solely on your own seeding (which is fine). Consider returning the resolved `episode_seed` even when the user doesn’t pass `seed` to `reset` (you do this already), and documenting that `episode_seed` may differ from the constructor seed due to wrapper reseeding.

- **Truncation signaling aligns with Gymnasium**: You set `terminated` on success and `truncated` on step cap, and include `TimeLimit.truncated` in `info`. Good. If users also wrap with `TimeLimit`, duplication is possible; recommend documenting that the env already enforces a time limit.

- **Info keys: pick a single success flag**: You now include both `success` and `is_success` on goal. Many tools expect `is_success`. Consider:
  - Always provide `is_success` (you do).
  - Mark `success` as deprecated in docs, or remove it to avoid ambiguity.

- **Symbolic observation space bounds improved, but normalization may help**:
  - Low/high now bound coordinates to board ranges and target one-hot to [0,1]; good.
  - For agents that assume roughly unit-scale inputs, consider normalizing coordinates to [0,1] (with a flag) or documenting current scaling so downstream preprocessing can normalize.

- **Wall-channel caching is correct and reset-aware**: `_build_cached_walls` precomputes the 4 wall channels and you call it in both reset paths. This should yield a real perf win. One extra safety:
  - Explicitly clear `_cached_wall_obs = None` at the start of `reset` before reuse (you rebuild it later, so not strictly needed, but helps avoid stale cache if future code paths evolve).

- **Action validation now early and clear**: The upfront range check in `step()` is great. Minor nit:
  - Consider raising `gymnasium.error.InvalidAction` if Gymnasium is present to align error types.

- **Consistent dtype handling**: Image obs are float32 in [0,1], symbolic obs are float32 within bounds; matches `observation_space.dtype`. Good.

- **Legacy API helpers present**: `close()` no-op and `seed()` legacy shim are provided. Good for broad compatibility.

- **Channel naming helper a nice touch**: `channel_names` property improves usability. Consider listing indices in the docstring, e.g., “0:wall_up, 1:wall_down, ...” for quick reference.

- **Generate-random-board determinism and safety**:
  - All randomness routes through `self.np_random`; deterministic with a fixed seed; good.
  - Goal and robot placements draw from unique `free_cells`; avoids overlaps; good.

- **Docstrings**: New docstrings are helpful. If you want to go one step further, summarize `info` keys in the class docstring as a compact reference.

- **Minor style/consistency**:
  - `metadata["render_fps"] = 4` is largely ignored for non-human modes; that’s fine, but you could clarify it’s not used for `"ascii"`.
  - In `_board_to_symbolic_obs`, you still emit unnormalized coordinates; that’s okay given the bounded space, just ensure tests or README mention the chosen convention.

Net: The integration now looks robust for Gymnasium 0.26+ and SB3. The only substantive issue I’d fix is the registration guard; everything else is polish and documentation improvements.
