**User**

You are a research engineer, working as part of a team to implement a research proposal. Please take the time to read the ResearchPlan.md. Your colleagues have already implemented and reviewed steps 1.1 - 1.4 of the plan, which have been checked and are deemed completed, so you do not need to worry about this. You can read the ProgressNotes left by your colleagues, and read the code they have written, in order to understand what you are working with.

Now, another colleague was given feedback I have attached, and asked to implement changes to address it.
Your task is to review the implementation of this feedback, comparing it to the specification and goals laid out in the ResearchPlan.md. It is unlikely that the plan has been implemented correctly, since this attempt was just a first pass, and you must provide feedback on what need to be changed in order to satisfy the specificaiton laid out in the plan. You should also feel free to think about the plan itself, and let me know if you think there are any issues with step 2 of the plan.

You are not to change any code, but instead to review the work and give a list of feedback, ordered roughly from highest importance to lowest. Be as critical as you can - it's really important that we get this step up to standard to set us up in a way which makes the rest of the research plan implementation as easy and smooth as possible. 
Please go ahead and get started.

**Cursor**

I'll help you review the implementation of the feedback regarding curriculum learning. Let me start by reading the ResearchPlan.md and understanding the current state of the project.


Now let me read the current curriculum implementation and related files to understand what was implemented:


Now let me examine the current environment implementation to understand how it integrates with the curriculum:


Now let me check the current state of the environment to understand how the curriculum integration works:


Now let me examine the specific issue with success tracking:


Now let me check how the environment actually determines success:


Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the curriculum implementation. Let me create a detailed review of the feedback implementation:


Based on my comprehensive review of the curriculum learning implementation, I can now provide detailed feedback on what needs to be changed to satisfy the research plan specifications. Here's my critical analysis:

## Critical Issues with Curriculum Learning Implementation

### 1. **FUNDAMENTAL SUCCESS TRACKING BUG** 
**Severity: CRITICAL**

The curriculum wrapper uses `info.get('level_solvable', False)` to determine success, but this is completely wrong. Looking at the environment code:

- `level_solvable` indicates whether the **puzzle was solvable when generated** (line 289 in ricochet_env.py)
- `is_success` indicates whether the **agent actually solved the puzzle** (line 330 in ricochet_env.py)

**Current broken logic:**
```python
success = info.get('level_solvable', False) and not truncated
```

**Should be:**
```python
success = info.get('is_success', False) and not truncated
```

This means the curriculum will advance based on whether puzzles were solvable, not whether the agent solved them. This completely breaks curriculum learning.

### 2. **MISSING DIFFICULTY FILTERING BY OPTIMAL LENGTH**
**Severity: CRITICAL**

The research plan explicitly states:
> "We can generate puzzles of increasing difficulty (measured by the optimal solution length). For instance, start with puzzles that require 3-5 moves to solve, then 5-7, and so on."

**What's missing:**
- No filtering of puzzles by `optimal_length` 
- No mechanism to ensure puzzles at each level have the specified maximum optimal length
- The `max_optimal_length` field in `CurriculumLevel` is defined but never used

**Required fix:** The environment generation must filter puzzles to only include those with `optimal_length <= level.max_optimal_length`.

### 3. **CURRICULUM PROGRESSION DOESN'T MATCH RESEARCH PLAN**
**Severity: HIGH**

The research plan specifies a specific progression:
> "We should plan the curriculum steps (for instance: start with one robot and no obstacles as a sanity check, then one robot with walls (like a maze), then multiple robots with simple configurations, and so on, up to full complexity)."

**Current implementation issues:**
- Level 0: 4×4, 1 robot, no walls - **CORRECT**
- Level 1: 6×6, 1 robot, some walls - **CORRECT** 
- Level 2: 8×8, 2 robots, more walls - **MISSING the "simple configurations" requirement**
- Level 3: 10×10, 3 robots, many walls - **MISSING the "full complexity" requirement**

The research plan emphasizes **gradual complexity increase**, but the current levels jump too quickly in multiple dimensions simultaneously.

### 4. **VECTORIZED ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION BROKEN**
**Severity: HIGH**

The curriculum wrapper creates a **single environment instance** but is used in a **vectorized environment** with multiple parallel environments. This means:

- Only one environment in the vector will have curriculum progression
- Other environments will stay at the initial level
- Success rate tracking is only from one environment, not the full vector
- This breaks the fundamental assumption of parallel training

**Required fix:** The curriculum wrapper needs to be designed for vectorized environments, or the training loop needs to handle curriculum progression at the vector level.

### 5. **MISSING AUTOMATIC DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION**
**Severity: HIGH**

The research plan states:
> "We can do this manually in the training loop: e.g., after X million steps, increase difficulty. Or a more automated criterion: if the agent's performance (success rate) on current level is > Y%, then increase difficulty."

**Current implementation issues:**
- Only checks advancement every 50 episodes (`advancement_check_frequency`)
- No mechanism to adjust difficulty based on training progress
- No integration with the training framework's success rate tracking
- The callback only logs stats but doesn't influence curriculum progression

### 6. **HARDCODED OBSERVATION MODE**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The curriculum wrapper hardcodes `obs_mode="image"` and `channels_first=True`, but the research plan supports both image and symbolic modes. This breaks flexibility and doesn't match the training framework's mode selection.

### 7. **MISSING CURRICULUM VALIDATION**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The research plan emphasizes testing and validation, but there's no mechanism to:
- Validate that curriculum levels are actually achievable
- Test that the progression makes sense
- Ensure puzzles at each level are solvable within the specified constraints

### 8. **INCOMPLETE INTEGRATION WITH TRAINING FRAMEWORK**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The curriculum callback only logs statistics but doesn't:
- Integrate with SB3's built-in success rate tracking
- Provide curriculum stats to TensorBoard
- Allow curriculum configuration through the CLI
- Support curriculum-specific hyperparameter tuning

## Recommended Fixes (Ordered by Priority)

### 1. **IMMEDIATE: Fix Success Tracking**
```python
# In curriculum.py step() method
success = info.get('is_success', False) and not truncated
```

### 2. **IMMEDIATE: Add Optimal Length Filtering**
The environment generation must filter puzzles by optimal length before creating the curriculum level.

### 3. **HIGH: Redesign for Vectorized Environments**
Either:
- Create a curriculum manager that coordinates across all vectorized environments
- Or modify the training loop to handle curriculum progression at the vector level

### 4. **HIGH: Fix Curriculum Progression**
Redesign the levels to match the research plan's gradual complexity increase.

### 5. **MEDIUM: Add Proper Integration**
Integrate curriculum progression with SB3's success rate tracking and TensorBoard logging.

### 6. **MEDIUM: Add Validation**
Add tests to ensure curriculum levels are achievable and progression makes sense.

## Issues with Step 2 of the Research Plan

The research plan itself has some issues:

1. **Ambiguous Success Rate Tracking**: The plan doesn't clearly specify how to track success rates across vectorized environments.

2. **Missing Curriculum Validation**: The plan doesn't include validation steps to ensure curriculum progression works correctly.

3. **Incomplete Integration Details**: The plan doesn't specify how curriculum learning integrates with SB3's callback system and logging.

The curriculum implementation is a good first attempt, but it has fundamental flaws that prevent it from working as intended. The success tracking bug alone makes it completely non-functional for its intended purpose.


```python
success = info.get('level_solvable', False) and not truncated
```

```python
success = info.get('is_success', False) and not truncated
```

```python
# In curriculum.py step() method
success = info.get('is_success', False) and not truncated
```
