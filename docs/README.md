# Documentation
This folder contains detailed specifications for (in `ComponentSpecifications`) and a summary of the progress made (in `ProgressNotes`) for various components in the Ricochet Robots (RR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) project.


## Progress Notes Overview
The folder ProgressNotes now organizes progress by concrete tasks, each with an implementation summary. Reviews are added separately as `<TASK>_Review.md` files.

### Task Index
- `Environment_Implementation.md`
- `Solver_Implementation.md`
- `PuzzleBank_Implementation.md`
- `TrainingFramework_Implementation.md`
- `Profiling_Implementation.md`
- `CurriculumBank_Implementation.md`
- `CurriculumBank_Review.md`

### Legacy Notes (kept for context)
- `decisions_and_rationale.md`
- `next_steps.md`


## Component Specifications Overview
Contains the detailed specs and descriptions for individual components of the RR RL plan
### Component index
 - `drc_implementation_instructions.md`: Deep Repeating Convolutional networks, a type of model used which aims to help agents to plan
 - `resnet_baseline_instructions.md`: Residual networks, a type of model which can be used for a pretty capable agent which acts as a good baseline against which we can measure agent performance.
 - `WallSpecifications.md`: Specifications for the wall layout of ricochet robots puzzles.
