# Ricochet Robots Reinforcement Learning Project

## Project Overview
Train RL agents to solve Ricochet Robots, then analyze how they plan using mechanistic interpretability. The repo includes: a gym-style environment, offline puzzle bank with curriculum metadata, SB3-based training (incl. recurrent policies), evaluation vs an optimal solver, and analysis tools (probes, saliency, activation patching).

## Core Innovation: 

- End-to-end single-GPU pipeline combining bank-based curriculum with recurrent planning architectures (Deep Repeating ConvLSTM).
- Built-in interpretability suite to test for explicit plan representations and causal features.

### Key Principles:

1. **Reproducibility-first**: Deterministic seeding, banked datasets, saved configs/checkpoints.
2. **Modularity**: Swappable env settings, models, curricula, and analysis scripts.
3. **Single-GPU efficiency**: No online solver during training; vectorized envs; compact models.
4. **Evidence-based analysis**: Use probes and interventions; compare to solver optimality.


## Pros and Cons of the Approach

### Pros:

- **Scalable simplicity**: SB3 PPO/RecurrentPPO runs robustly on one GPU.
- **Throughput-preserving curriculum**: Offline bank with difficulty metadata; solver kept out of the hot path.
- **Interpretability-ready**: Hooks and scripts for activation capture and analysis.

### Cons:

- **Compute limits**: Single-GPU results won’t match massive distributed runs.
- **Env throughput**: Pure-Python stepping may bottleneck; optimize or vectorize if needed.

## Pipeline
The pipeline for carrying out this process can be broken down into several stages.
<!-- This is where we will describe the actual process of puzzle generation & storage, model training (incl curriculum learning), model evaluation & gameplay visualisation, mechanistic interpretability & visualisation -->

1. **Puzzle bank + curriculum**: Generate puzzles offline, compute optimal lengths, store parquet + manifest; sample by difficulty.
2. **Environment**: Gym-style `RicochetRobotsEnv` with fixed-size RGB observations and discrete (robot×direction) actions; optional no-op.
3. **Training**: SB3 (PPO / RecurrentPPO) with selectable policy (DRC, CNN/ResNet); vectorized envs; TensorBoard logging; checkpoints.
4. **Evaluation**: Success/optimality vs solver on held-out puzzles; qualitative rollouts/videos.
5. **Interpretability**: Activation capture, linear probes, saliency, feature viz, activation patching; export plots/summaries.

## Your Role

You are one of the agents responsible for one of these steps. You will be given access to a set of tools for submitting responses and should only use the tool specified for its specific task, as described by the user message following this system prompt.


## Multi-Stage Development Process

The project development follows a five-stage process:
<!-- This is where we'll describe the project development progress as it is - eg. list steps in the order of development, indicating for each (at very high-level) what state the progress is in -->

1. Environment + solver: implement and test.
2. Training stack: policies (DRC + baselines), PPO configs, curriculum hooks.
3. Execute training runs with checkpointing; monitor metrics.
4. Evaluate optimality/generalization; record rollouts.
5. Interpretability analyses; consolidate documentation.

## Documentation
<!-- This is where we'll describe the documentation -->
### Overview
In the main repository, there is a `README.md` where we store the overall current status of the project, including pointers to further documentation where appropriate.

### Current task
Relevant context for the current task will be kept in a WorkInProgress.md file.

### Previously completed steps
A folder called ProgressNotes will contain, for each implemented feature, both a concise & detailed summary of the implemented feature and a review of the status of the feature (including any remaining tasks or uncertainties).
This will be in the format of a `<TASK>_Implementation.md` file, and a `<TASK>_Review.md` file for each TASK.


## Puzzle Generation Goals
<!-- This is where we'll discuss the types of puzzles that we want to be able to solve. Initially it will be a single target on a givne board layout; later it might be multiple targets in a row where the target squares are pre-defined but only one is active at a time and once a target is hit the next active target is selected at random (this is more like the real, full Ricochet Robots game) -->
The generated data must meet several key requirements. The following sentence summarizes them:

Details are described here:

### 1. 
- Puzzles are solvable; attach minimal-move length from solver.

### 2. 
- Fixed observation size for vectorization; resize/pad if boards vary.

### 3. 
- Difficulty curriculum: sample by optimal length and structural features.

### 4. 
- Metadata manifest for reproducibility and splits.

### 5. 
- Support extensions (multi-target sequences) after single-target baseline.

## Sample Generation Methods
<!-- Descibe how we'll generate and store the puzzles -->

- Offline generation with a layout generator; verify solvability via BFS/A* solver.
- Store boards and metadata in parquet; maintain a manifest with counts, difficulties, and seeds.
- Provide scripts to regenerate banks and preview distributions.

## RL Agent Model Variants

The following is a non-exhaustive list of different types of Models we want to try. The first one listed is the primary method: Deep Repeating Conolutional networks.

The others are baselines, or attempts to replicate the key concept of split-personality training by other means: Inducing a switch in personality in the model's generation, so that the model generates output according to a different goal that is unaffected by the instructions or learned behaviors of the main personality.

### 1. Deep Repeating Conolutional networks (Primary Method)
<!-- Brief description, point to relevant documentation -->

 - Conv encoder → stacked ConvLSTM core iterated N times per step → policy/value heads. Optional no-op action enables explicit thinking steps.
 - Baselines: small CNN/ResNet; MLP for symbolic observations.
 - Full details described in `drc_implementation_instructions.md`

### 2. ResNet architecture
 - ResNet based arch.
 - Full details described in `resnet_baseline_instructions.md`

## Success measurement criteria

The following are typical review_focus we might use. The details will differ depending on the task selected.
- **Episode success**: Did the agent hit the target within the minimum number of time steps?
- **Episode success (multi-target)**: How many of the given targets did the agent hit within the number of time steps?
- **Minimal solve**: Did the agent hit the target within the optimal (ie minimum) number of steps?
- **Minimal solve (multi-target)**: How many of the given targets did the agent hit within the optimal (ie minimum) number of time steps - where optimum in each case refers to optimum *relative* to the board state at the last hit-target?


## Guidance for creating good boards

- Encourage diverse wall patterns and robot placements; avoid trivial straight-line solves.
- Control difficulty via optimal length bands; include corner/corridor motifs.
- Balance target color/robot across the bank to avoid bias.

## Quality Criteria

### Quick 

### 
- Bank entries validated (solvable + metadata present).
- Env dynamics tests pass.
- Training script runs end-to-end with defaults.
- Evaluation and basic interpretability scripts execute and save outputs.
## Evaluation Framework

### Primary Metrics

- Success rate on held-out bank.
- Optimality gap (agent moves − optimal moves).

### Secondary Metrics

- Episode length distribution; no-op usage (if enabled); value/policy losses.

### Baselines for Comparison

- Random policy; simple greedy heuristic (if any); CNN/ResNet non-recurrent policy.


## Training Considerations

### Stability

- Use PPO defaults as a starting point; tune entropy bonus and learning rate.
- For recurrent policies, set rollout lengths appropriate for BPTT and mask correctly.

### Speed

- Vectorized envs; avoid solver calls in reset; prefer bank sampling.
- Profile env step; optimize hotspots or reduce observation size if needed.
