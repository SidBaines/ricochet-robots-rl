**User**

You are a research engineer, working as part of a team to implement a research proposal. Please take the time to read the ResearchPlan.md. Your colleagues have already implemented and reviewed steps 1.1 - 1.4 of the plan, which have been checked and are deemed completed, so you do not need to worry about this. You can read the ProgressNotes left by your colleagues, and read the code they have written, in order to understand what you are working with.

Now, another colleague has implemented step 2 of the plan, detailed in ResearchPlan.md.
Your task is to review the implementation of step 2, comparing it to the specification and goals laid out in the ResearchPlan.md. It is unlikely that the plan has been implemented correctly, since this attempt was just a first pass, and you must provide feedback on what need to be changed in order to satisfy the specificaiton laid out in the plan. You should also feel free to think about the plan itself, and let me know if you think there are any issues with step 2 of the plan.

You are not to change any code, but instead to review the work and give a list of feedback, ordered roughly from highest importance to lowest. Be as critical as you can - it's really important that we get this step up to standard to set us up in a way which makes the rest of the research plan implementation as easy and smooth as possible. 
Please go ahead and get started.

I'll help you review the implementation of step 2 from the research plan. Let me start by reading the ResearchPlan.md and the progress notes to understand the context and requirements.


Now let me read the remaining progress notes to understand what was completed in steps 1.1-1.4:


Now let me examine the current implementation to understand what was done for step 2. Let me look at the training and model files:


Now let me check the requirements and see what dependencies are being used:


Now let me check if there are any tests for the training implementation:


Now let me check if there are any other training-related files or configurations:


Now let me create a comprehensive todo list to track my review and then provide my detailed feedback:


Based on my comprehensive review of the Step 2 implementation against the ResearchPlan.md specifications, I have identified several critical issues that need to be addressed. Here is my detailed feedback, ordered from highest to lowest importance:

## Critical Issues (Highest Priority)

### 1. **Missing Curriculum Learning Implementation** 
**Severity: CRITICAL**

The research plan explicitly requires curriculum learning as a core component of Step 2, but it's completely missing from the implementation. The plan states:

> "We will incorporate **curriculum learning** (if needed) by adjusting the environment or training schedule... One approach is to divide training into phases. For example, train for some number of updates on simple puzzles (small board or fewer moves needed). Once the agent achieves a high success rate there, increase the difficulty."

**What's missing:**
- No curriculum wrapper or callback to adjust difficulty
- No mechanism to filter puzzles by `optimal_length` 
- No automatic difficulty progression based on success rate
- No curriculum steps (1 robot → walls → multiple robots → full complexity)

**Impact:** This is a fundamental requirement that affects the entire training strategy and agent performance.

### 2. **Incomplete ConvLSTM Integration with SB3**
**Severity: CRITICAL**

The ConvLSTM implementation has a fundamental flaw - it returns hidden states but SB3's standard policies don't handle recurrent state management. The plan requires:

> "We'll integrate an LSTM that maintains hidden state across time steps. SB3 has a _RecurrentPPO_ implementation (in SB3-contrib) that we might leverage for the training loop (handling hidden states, etc.), or we handle it manually."

**What's wrong:**
- `ConvLSTMFeaturesExtractor.forward()` returns `(features, hidden_states)` but SB3 expects just features
- No integration with `RecurrentPPO` or manual hidden state management
- Hidden states are not preserved across environment steps
- The recurrent nature is completely lost

**Impact:** The ConvLSTM model cannot actually function as a recurrent network, making it equivalent to a regular CNN.

### 3. **Missing Key Hyperparameters from Research Plan**
**Severity: HIGH**

Several critical hyperparameters specified in the plan are missing or incorrectly set:

**Missing:**
- PPO clip range (plan specifies ~0.2, not set)
- GAE lambda (plan specifies 0.95, not set) 
- Value loss coefficient (plan specifies 0.5, not set)
- Gradient clipping (plan specifies ~0.5 or 1.0, not set)
- Reward normalization control (plan says disable for sparse rewards)

**Incorrect:**
- Default timesteps is 100k, but plan suggests 5e6 to 1e7 for meaningful training
- No learning rate scheduling as mentioned in plan

### 4. **Inadequate Monitoring and Evaluation**
**Severity: HIGH**

The plan requires comprehensive monitoring that's largely missing:

**Missing:**
- No success rate logging in callbacks
- No optimality gap measurement against solver
- No periodic evaluation on fixed test set
- No trajectory analysis or qualitative behavior monitoring
- No no-op usage monitoring (for thinking behavior)

**Present but inadequate:**
- Basic TensorBoard logging exists but doesn't track key metrics
- Evaluation callback exists but doesn't measure optimality

## Major Issues (High Priority)

### 5. **Incomplete DRC Architecture Implementation**
**Severity: HIGH**

The ConvLSTM implementation doesn't match the Deep Repeating ConvLSTM (DRC) specification:

**Missing from plan:**
- Pool-and-inject mechanism (global pooled info to each step)
- Boundary padding channel
- Proper DRC(D,N) terminology implementation
- No non-linearity on final encoding layer (as noted in Sokoban analysis)

**Current implementation is too simplified** compared to the referenced literature.

### 6. **No Thinking Steps Implementation**
**Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The plan emphasizes thinking steps as a key feature:

> "We might first train the agent without using the no-op (force it to solve without extra thinking), then later allow no-ops and see if it learns to use them."

**Missing:**
- No curriculum for thinking steps (train without no-op, then with)
- No monitoring of no-op usage patterns
- No analysis of "pacing behavior" mentioned in plan

### 7. **Missing Single-GPU Optimizations**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The plan includes specific single-GPU considerations that aren't implemented:

**Missing:**
- No vectorized environment optimization notes
- No performance profiling guidance
- No memory management considerations for ConvLSTM
- No speed optimization recommendations

## Moderate Issues (Medium Priority)

### 8. **Incomplete Model Architecture Options**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

The plan requires multiple architectures for comparison:

**Missing:**
- No ResNet baseline implementation (mentioned in plan)
- No MLP for symbolic observations (only basic MLP policy)
- No proper architecture selection framework

### 9. **Limited Environment Configuration**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Missing:**
- No difficulty parameter controls for curriculum
- No `env.set_max_moves(n)` functionality
- No automated difficulty progression

### 10. **Insufficient Testing for Training Components**
**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Missing:**
- No tests for curriculum learning
- No tests for ConvLSTM hidden state management
- No integration tests for full training pipeline
- No performance benchmarks

## Minor Issues (Lower Priority)

### 11. **Documentation Gaps**
**Severity: LOW-MEDIUM**

**Missing:**
- No training README section as mentioned in plan
- No hyperparameter tuning guidance
- No architecture comparison documentation

### 12. **Code Organization Issues**
**Severity: LOW**

**Issues:**
- Training script is monolithic (plan suggests modular design)
- No separate curriculum utilities
- No interpretability scaffolding preparation

## Recommendations for Immediate Action

1. **Implement curriculum learning** as the top priority - this is fundamental to the research plan
2. **Fix ConvLSTM integration** with proper recurrent state management
3. **Add missing hyperparameters** and proper PPO configuration
4. **Implement comprehensive monitoring** with success rate, optimality gap, and behavior analysis
5. **Complete the DRC architecture** according to the referenced literature

The current implementation is a good start but misses several critical components that are essential for the research objectives. The curriculum learning and ConvLSTM issues are particularly concerning as they directly impact the core research goals.
