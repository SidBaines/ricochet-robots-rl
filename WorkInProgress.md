## Current task
We've implemented stage 2 of the development process, and we're in the process of checking it. At the moment, we're focussing on getting the training code to work properly.
Currently, we are working ontidying up this repository. 
I'd like you to move it so that we have a src directory containing all the code (ie the env, models, monitoring, profiling and tests directories and finally also a scripts directory which contains the runnable python scripts), the docs (which already exists and contains all the documentation except for the high level README), the configs and examples directories. The directories which are generated by our code, so the wandb, checkpoints and logs are put into an artifacts directory, and rlenv is our local python environment so we can ignore this too. So I think your main work will be to restructure the source directory, and make sure that imports within the files (modules and runnable scripts) are handled to account for this new structure and the code still runs without import errors. You can ignore the tmp directory for now.
So it will look something like this:

- ./artifacts/
    - ./artifacts/checkpoints
    - ./artifacts/logs
    - ./artifacts/runs
    - ./artifacts/puzzle_bank
    - ./artifacts/wandb
- ./config
- ./docs
- ./examples
- ./src
    - ./src/env
    - ./src/models
    - ./src/monitoring
    - ./src/profiling
    - ./src/scripts
        - In here we will put initial_testing_cells.py, initial_visualisation_cells.py, train_agent.py, generate_curriculum_bank.py, all other currently-top-level .py scripts
    - ./src/tests

If anything is unclear, feel free to ask questions by writing them in this file (WorkInProgress.md).
## Progress (latest)
- Created `src/` package hierarchy and relocated `env`, `models`, `monitoring`, `profiling`, `tests`, and all runnable scripts under `src/scripts`; generated outputs now live in the new `artifacts/` tree.
- Updated import paths across packages, scripts, and tests to reference the new structure (added bootstrap logic so direct script execution still works) and introduced package initialisers.
- Normalised default paths to point into `artifacts/` (CLI args, configs, monitoring defaults, curriculum tooling) and added convenience constants for scripts/utilities.
- Ran `python -m compileall src` as an import sanity check; `pytest` is currently unavailable in the environment (`ModuleNotFoundError`).
- README: Updated quick-start commands, repo map, and references to reflect the new `src/` package and `artifacts/` output structure (commands now use `python src/scripts/...`).


## Next steps
- Install `pytest` (or the project test requirements) and execute the full test suite to confirm nothing else regressed.
- Update any user-facing docs/README snippets that still reference the old top-level script locations or artifact paths.
