**Note** *When discussing particular cells for examples below, we take the convention that the (i, j)th square is in the ith row and the jth column, counting with 0-up indexing. This may or may not match what happens in the code, and you should be careful of this*

- Boards should always be square
- Even-length sided boards should have walls around the central 2x2 square; odd-length sided boards should have walls around the central 1x1 square. This is referred to as the 'forbidden-central-block'
- Neither robots nor the target position can ever be inside this central square.
- Boards should have two types of additional wall structures: 'edge-T' and 'central-L' (defined below)
  - 'Edge-T' structures consist of a single wall 'jutting out' from one of the eddges of the board, thus creating a 'T' shape when considered with the wall edges themselves. So, for example, a vertical wall placed between cells (0,3) and (0,4) would create a T shape with the horizontal north boundary wall and the jutting piece we add.
  - 'Central-L' structures consist of a pair of walls, neither of which overlap with or touch any existing walls (board boundary walls or the central), which create an 'L' shape on the board - that is, they form part of the boundary of the same square. For example, in a 16x16 board: a vertical boundary between (3,4) and (3,5), and a horizontal boundary between (3,4) and (4,4) - this forms part of the boundary of the cell in position (3,4) since there exist walls to the right to the bottom of it.
    - 'Central-L' walls have an orientation: the corner at which the two walls intersect will be at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left or bottom-right of a cell. For example, in the case given above, the orientation is bottom-right since the walls around the cell in question are to the right and to the bottom.
- It should be configurable how many of each of these two types of wall a board has per 'quadrant', where a quadrant refers to the north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east quarters of the board. By defauilt, a board of side length n should have 2 of each wall-type per quadrant if n<10 and 4 of each wall type per quadrant if n>=10
- For 'central-L' walls, there should always be as even a distribution of orientations as possible within each quadrant. For example if there are 2 central-L structures per quadrant, then there should be 2 different central-L strucutre orientations within each quadrant (no quadrant should have two of the same type) but there can be repeated orientations across quadrants. If there are 5 walls per quadrant, then each quadrant will have exactly 3 orientations with one 'central-L' strucutre carrying this orientation, and one orientation with two 'central-L' strucutres carrying this orientation.
- Central-L structures cannot be around an edge square
- No cell should have more than 1 wall strucuture surrounding it (central-L, edge-T or the forbidden-central-block).
- Any cell with a wall around it (excluding boundary edge walls, but including walls from central-L, jutting walls from edge-T or the forbidden-central-block) cannot have any of its neighbours be the square around which a central-L or edge-T block is formed.
- Edge-T structure cannot produce jutting walls which are boundaries to walls on the corner. So for example, an edge-T structure which places a jutting vertical wall to the right of (0,1) is okay, but an edge-T strucutre which places a jutting vertial wall to the left of (0,1) or equivalently to the right of (0,0) is not okay
- Target square should always be a central-L square
